# **Naive Bayes Classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis**

This project compares the implementation of the Naive Bayes (NB) classification algorithm from scratch against the built-in library function for diagnosing breast cancer based on a dataset. The aim is to highlight the efficiency and accuracy of a custom NB implementation versus the built-in approach.

---

## **Project Overview**
Breast cancer diagnosis is critical for early detection and treatment. This project focuses on preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the features, and implementing the Naive Bayes classifier to classify data into malignant or benign categories. 

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes features derived from images of breast masses and contains both quantitative and categorical data. The diagnosis column serves as the target variable, indicating whether a tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

---

## **Steps and Methodology**

### **1. Preprocessing**
- **Label Encoding**: The `diagnosis` column is converted to numeric values for compatibility with the classifier.
- **Data Type Classification**: Features are categorized as either quantitative or categorical.
- **Feature Selection**: A heat map is used to select the target feature (`diagnosis`) and independent features:
  ```
  diagnosis, radius_mean, smoothness_mean, texture_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean
  ```
- **Outlier Detection & Removal**:
  - Interquartile Range (IQR) method
  - Z-score method
- **Feature Standardization**: Standardizes data for consistent scaling.
- **Data Splitting**: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.

---

### **2. Feature Analysis**
- **Analyzing Feature Distributions**:
  Histograms are used to visualize feature distributions. Observations include:
  - **radius_mean**: Approximately normal with overlapping distributions for benign and malignant.
  - **smoothness_mean**: Normally distributed.
  - **texture_mean**: Slightly right-skewed.
  - **compactness_mean**: Moderately right-skewed.
  - **concavity_mean**: Right-skewed.
  - **symmetry_mean**: Approximately normal.
  - **fractal_dimension_mean**: Slightly right-skewed.

- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**:
  Statistically tests the normality of each feature.

### **3. Naive Bayes Implementation**
#### **Manual Implementation**
A custom Naive Bayes classifier was implemented using:
- Probability estimation for each feature.
- Gaussian assumptions for numerical data distributions.

#### **Built-in Library**
The built-in Naive Bayes function from a standard machine learning library was used for comparison.

---

## **Results**

Both implementations produced identical results, confirming the accuracy of the manual implementation.

### **Performance Metrics**
| Metric            | Manual Implementation | Built-in Library |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Accuracy**       | 92.6%                 | 92.6%           |
| **Precision**      | 93.5%                 | 93.5%           |
| **Recall**         | 85.3%                 | 85.3%           |
| **F1-Score**       | 89.2%                 | 89.2%           |
